- 👋 Hi, I’m Jack!
- 🌱 I'm currently a masters student in the Geological Sciences and Geological Engineering Department at Queen's University at Kingston
- 👀 I’m interested in: 
	* Applied geophysics 
	* Near-surface seismology and micro-seismics (full-waveform inversion, wave propagation, anisotropic/porous media...)
	* Ground-penetrating radar
	* Numerical methods (SPECFEM, SIEM)
	* Forward and inverse modelling
	* High performance computing
	* Machine learning
- ⏮ Previously I've worked on:
	* Geochemical modelling of trace elements in the Great Lakes
	* Sounding rocket payload development
	* Glacial isostatic adjustment modelling
	* Autonomous survey vehicle development
- 👩🏻‍💻 Learning and using Rust, shakti/k9, APL, MATLAB/Octave, Python, Fortran, C/C++
- 📫 Want to collaborate or talk shop? Feel free to reach out to 17jcf1 at queensu dot ca
